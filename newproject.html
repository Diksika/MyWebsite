  <h1 class="gap"> Hello and Namaste!</h1>
  <h1 class="about">About me</h1>
 
  <p>
    Welcome to my life's journey.<br />
     I help bridge the gap between people and technology as a Service Desk Analyst.<br/>
      My journey began with a Bachelor's in Information Technology, and I've been immersed in the IT world for nearly a year now.</p>
 
      <h1 class="background">Background</h1>

    <p> I was born in a heart of Newar community in Kathmandu.As destiny would have it, I was born as a middle child with two incredible sisters<br/>
    As a child I was very shy and introvert but within the wall of my loving family, I found a sanctuary where I could truly be myself. Our home became a place where we created our own imaginary world, shared laughter and kept ourselves content.
    I was always a studious child, and this dedication earned me recognition from my parents, teachers and peers. I proudly ended my school years as the school topper.
